# Active Context

## Current Issue
The project has a missing dependency issue. The `update-user.dto.ts` file imports `PartialType` from `@nestjs/mapped-types`, but this package is not listed in the `package.json` dependencies.

## Current State
- NestJS application with Clean Architecture structure
- User domain with basic CRUD operations
- Environment configuration module implemented
- Missing `@nestjs/mapped-types` dependency causing import errors

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Add missing `@nestjs/mapped-types` dependency to package.json
2. Install the dependency
3. Verify all imports are working correctly
4. Run tests to ensure everything is functioning

## Recent Changes
- Project structure follows Clean Architecture principles
- Users module with controller, service, and DTOs
- Environment configuration module in shared infrastructure
- Domain entity for User created

## Active Decisions
- Using NestJS as the main framework
- Implementing Clean Architecture with proper layer separation
- Using Jest for testing
- Environment configuration through dedicated module

## Current Focus
Resolving dependency issues and ensuring the project can run without errors.
