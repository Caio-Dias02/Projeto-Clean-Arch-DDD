# Project Brief: Clean Architecture DDD with NestJS

## Project Overview
A NestJS application implementing Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. The project aims to demonstrate proper separation of concerns, domain modeling, and maintainable code structure.

## Core Requirements
- Implement Clean Architecture layers (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation)
- Follow DDD principles with proper domain modeling
- Use NestJS framework for the application structure
- Maintain separation between business logic and infrastructure concerns
- Implement proper dependency injection and inversion of control

## Project Goals
- Create a scalable and maintainable codebase
- Demonstrate Clean Architecture best practices
- Show proper domain entity modeling
- Implement proper DTOs and validation
- Set up proper testing structure
- Configure environment management

## Current Scope
- User domain with CRUD operations
- Environment configuration management
- Basic NestJS application structure
- Testing setup with Jest

## Success Criteria
- Clean separation of concerns across layers
- Proper domain entity implementation
- Working CRUD operations for users
- Environment configuration working
- All tests passing
- No dependency issues
